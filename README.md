- Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.
- Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
- The sort order can be by most popular, or by top rated
- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
        - original title
        - movie poster image thumbnail
        - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
        - user rating (called vote_average in the api)
        - release date
